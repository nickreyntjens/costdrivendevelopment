    	An api is a tool for programmers to communicate intent to other programmers.

    <blockquote>
        It can be easier and more rewarding to build something more general

    <blockquote>
        An API can be one of a companies greatest liabilities. 
     It can inhibit the ability to move forward and lead to an endless stream of support calls

    It can detect a myriad of mistakes that programmers often make. Having a statistically typed language is the first step towards having fast feedback. For the weakly typed fan out there that claim that your unit tests can replace a compiler. This is only true of your units tests reach 100% coverage, which is very hard and not vary useful. The reality is that the compiler is the cheapest tester that exists! </p>

    <p>Programmers can help the compiler do its job, or work agains it.

    <p> Yet that is exactly what many frameworks that get introduced today do. Many frameworks today use a thing called 'reflection'. Sounds scary right? It is! I cannot go into details about it here, but while reflection can in rare cases be useful. It mostly always is harmful. Google it if you want. </p>
    <p> I cannot go into detail about all frameworks out there, so I will discuss just framework that that use reflection and I will illustrate what effect it has one the software coding.
