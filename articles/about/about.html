The Cost Reduction Mission (CRM) is the reference on how to reduce the software development costs of an organisation. It is a strategic roadmap that allows managers to take charge and dramatically reduce their software developments costs of their projects.
</p>
<p>
The cost reduction mission framework (CRMF) has been especially developed to guide key descision makers to set policies that guide all software development related activities.  Key resource draining activities are examined and modified to be more efficient. The cost reduction mission (CRM) is a bridge. A bridge that gives managers high level insight into frequently occuring problems in the software development industry. This insight allows them to take change and guide the various development activities so that they stay on time and on budget. 
</p>
<p>
It also gives business owners insight into why simplistic outsourcing models don't work. Without the correct policies in place that streamline development, the gain of reduced salaries will often be overshadowed by incurred costs of bad design or requirements gathering. The reality is that the cost of a software project is largely dependent on how the problem is tackeled.
</p>

Software is different from other disciplines in some aspects. Firstly, it has the higest difference in productivity among most disciplines known to man. It is known that certain programmers are up to 20 times more productive then their peers. These extreme difference cannot be found in any other discipline. Secondly, it is know that the proficiency of programmers to solve a given problem is largely independent of age and experience. This is in great contrast to most other disciples where the expertise of an individual can be coupled with their experience.

<p>
Simular to making music, programming is an art and everybody can do it up to a certain level. Music consists out of a very limited amount of building blocks (12 semitones). The difficulty lies in combining them into a consistent hole. Programming is very simular. It too consists out of only a handfull of building blocks (if, then, while, for ...) and simular to music, the difficulty lies in combining them. But very diffenent from music is the fact that while untrained individuals can immediately hear the difference in quality between to pieces of music, to the untrained eye, code looks like code no matter how elegant or inelegant it is structured.   
</p>
<p>
The cost reduction mission aim is to hand business owners and key descision makes the tools they need to evalute different stategies on how to tackle problems that they will encounter in the software development process. While the suggested solution may not always be the ones that are right for you, knowing which aspects to consider will be off incredible value to you. If only you see the problem now, where before you did not, the gain will be enormous.

The cost reduction mission is the brain child of Nick Reyntjens. An active consultant and OO evangelist he is well recognised in the open source community for his work. Besides providing consultancy, he also actively runs his company Acelica.com where he practices what he preaches and achieves small miricles on a daily basis.
