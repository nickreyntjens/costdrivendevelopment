  <h1>Welcome.</h1>
  <article>
    <p> This website is all about how companies can dramatically reduce their software development costs. 
      It is aimed at managers and key decision makers that are faced with hard choices in their software producing companies. </p>
    <p> Through a series a articles the author tries to give clear explainations to common sources of money leakage. 
      Some of this advice is based on books, some on logical though and some on experience of the author. </p>
    <p> This work differentiates itself form other literature by evaluating how well a technology works 
      based on rational arguments, in contrast to being based on how well a technology is marketed.
      As an example, the arguments: 'Technology X is used in many companies all over the world, therefore it must be good' or 
      'Person Y with a good name said that technology X is good' will not be accepted as valid 
      because they do not state the inherent reasons why technology X is good, 
      rather they just use circular references. 
      Circular references or third party references are the valid arguments of marketeers, not of engineers.<br />
    </p>
    <p> On a side note: Many open source software projects are receiving millions of dollars from venture capitalists, they aren heavenly marketed. Be very careful when selecting software based on third party references, rather evaluate the inherent value that they bring. </p>
